## Personal Project

Hey. This is a personal project exploring coop "couch" games in an effort to convince myself couch games are still alive and kicking. Which they're not. This will be my first completed R coded project after teaching myself for the last 8 months.<br><br>
I hope I can look back to this project in a few years to see the progress I've made. Like that 1st year coursework you look back on riddle with errors.<br>
<h3>The Journey</h3>
Requested data via API - using httr and jsonlite packages
<br> Data wrangling heavily nested data - tidyverse 
<br>  Plotting data - GGplot
<br>   Building app with Shiny & Shinydashboard packages along with basic CSS & HTML files 
<br>    Optimisation using Profis & Microbenchmarking packages along with cached plots
